# attacksimulator
Attack Simulator is a WPF application designed to demonstrate successful attack scenarios in Windows environments. It visually simulates process injection techniques similar to those used in real-world attacks (like those in Atomic Red Team tests) while providing detailed security context information about the simulated attack.
